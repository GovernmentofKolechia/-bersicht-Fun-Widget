# README
You have the right to use the Widget's as much as you want and it's fully customizable however please dont publish it without sending an email to me because I'll be very sad but you might still use the code.

Read This:
If you dont know ".css" coding PLEASE dont touch the codes all by yourself or just dont touch.
It might break down and I will not be helping you because I publish only verified (by me) and working versions. If it breaks down because of the user, fix it yourself or get a new Zip.
You have the rights to change the Emojis etc.
I would love to help if you want to change something in your code like The Rotations, walking speed, emojis etc. Just email me!
!DONT USE FOR MATURE CONTENTS! (I beg you)
I'll make new and new versions for better experience time by time.
Thanks for Using! (yes .json HAS JESSE PINKMAN AS AUTHOR)
